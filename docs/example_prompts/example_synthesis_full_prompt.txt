Multiple organic functionalities can now be apportioned into
nanoscale domains within a metal-coordinated framework, posing
the following question: how do we control the resulting combi-
nation of “heterogeneity and order”? Here, we report the creation
of a metal–organic framework, MOF-2000, whose two component
types are incorporated in a 2:1 ratio, even when the ratio of com-
ponent types in the starting solution is varied by an order of mag-
nitude. Statistical mechanical modeling suggests that this robust
2:1 ratio has a nonequilibrium origin, resulting from kinetic trap-
ping of component types during framework growth. Our simula-
tions show how other “magic number” ratios of components can
be obtained by modulating the topology of a framework and the
noncovalent interactions between component types, a finding that
may aid the rational design of functional multicomponent materials.

The assembly of multiple types of component offers a poten-

tial route to the precise control of component heterogeneity
within ordered 3D frameworks. Metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) (1–5) possessing well-defined connectivities (6, 7) and
tunable pore sizes (8–10) can assemble from a variety of building
blocks (11–17). Recently, a MOF harboring two components
distributed in a heterogeneous fashion on an ordered framework
was demonstrated (1, 2). There exists no framework, however,
whose component heterogeneity remains controlled in the face of
changes of environment. Here, we report the creation of a material
with exactly this property. MOF-2000 is assembled from two types
of organic struts, called Lr and Lb (Fig. 1A). These struts have
identical rigid backbones but bear either a crown ether (Lr) or [2]
catenane (Lb) side chain attached at their center. X-ray diffraction
of MOF-2000 single crystals revealed that struts form a twofold
interpenetrated cubic framework of pcu-c topology (Fig. 1A, Right,
and SI Appendix, section S1.3; structure available in Dataset S1).
As a result of optical investigations, we confirmed that the two
struts are distributed in the crystalline framework in an isotropic
manner (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the two components are not
distributed in a simple periodic way throughout the framework
(because such arrangements would give rise to optical anisotropy;
SI Appendix, section S1.5).

Even though the arrangement of the two components in
MOF-2000 is indiscernible by X-ray crystallography, presumably
as a result of the positional disorder of the two strut types
within the framework, and the rotational (11, 18) and con-
formational (11) disorder of the side chains, the presence of
the two organic struts can be clearly determined by 1H-NMR
(SI Appendix, section S1.4). Strikingly, MOF-2000 displays a
2:1 ratio of Lr and Lb struts, even when the ratios of compo-
nents in the parent solution are varied by over an order of
magnitude (Fig. 1C). This feature makes MOF-2000 unique
among multicomponent extended frameworks, whose struts
are usually incorporated in ratios determined largely by initial
solution conditions (1, 19). Thus, MOF-2000 incorporates

environmentally robust component heterogeneity within a regu-
lar covalent framework (Fig. 1D).

The robust 2:1 composition does not have an obvious ther-
modynamic origin, in contrast to common organic cocrystals or
ionic systems such as CsCl (20). The latter possess robust com-
positions as a consequence of charge complementarity. In MOF-
2000, the Lb strut bears a charge of +4 (neutralized in the as-
sembly by counterions), whereas the Lr strut is uncharged. Thus,
charge complementarity alone does not suggest a 2:1 component
ratio. Simple packing arguments suggest that it is reasonable that
Lb is not the majority species within the framework (because it is
bulky), but likewise do not offer a simple explanation for the
2:1 ratio.

Modeling MOF-2000
To make further progress in understanding this robust ratio,
we built a simple and physically motivated computer model of
MOF-2000. As its degrees of freedom, the model considers the
type of strut at a given spatial location (a “node”) within the
framework (Fig. 2A, Left). Each node is colored red or blue,
representing the struts Lr or Lb, respectively. Because the phys-
ically interpenetrated cubic lattices that comprise MOF-2000
present each node with four nearest-neighbor nodes, all on the

Significance

Arranging multiple component types in a controlled manner
within solid frameworks may one day allow us to combine
the heterogeneity characteristic of biological materials with the
robustness characteristic of synthetic ones. Here, we report the
synthesis of a metal–organic framework whose two compo-
nent types are incorporated within it in a manner that is robust
with respect to changes of solution composition. Calculations
done on a model system suggest that this robustness occurs
because component types become kinetically trapped during
framework growth. Our calculations also show how different
controlled arrangements of component types might be obtained
by varying their noncovalent interactions, or by varying the to-
pology of the covalent framework within which they are housed.

adjacent cubic lattice, we allowed each node to interact ener-
getically with its four nearest neighbors (green bonds between
nodes; Fig. 2A, Middle). The nodes and noncovalent interactions
between nearest neighbors comprise a “virtual” side-chain in-
teraction network with nbo topology (Fig. 2 A, Right, and B).
Because side chains likely possess considerable conformational
and rotational freedom, we assume they do not interact in a
directional manner. We therefore considered only isotropic in-
teraction energies between nodes. As an additional simplifying
assumption, we made these interactions pairwise: bonds between
red nodes have energy «r-r; bonds between blue nodes have en-
ergy «b-b; and red–blue bonds have energy «b-r. For the purposes
of structure sampling, we considered only fully populated lattices,
and without loss of generality we set «r-r to zero. The resulting
description of MOF-2000 is equivalent to the Ising model on an
nbo framework (SI Appendix, section S2.1).

Local Energy Minima of the MOF-2000 Interaction Network
Display “Magic Number” Component Ratios for Particular
Hierarchies of Interaction Energies
Standard Monte Carlo simulations (Methods Summary) of this
model revealed no thermodynamically stable 2:1 red:blue phase
at any temperature (SI Appendix, Figs. S10 and S11). As shown in
Fig. 3, however, there does exist a set of nonequilibrium states of
the model that display such a ratio. These nonequilibrium states
correspond to “inherent structures” (or “local energy minima”)
of the model Hamiltonian (21, 22). To generate these structures,
we started with a framework whose nodes were colored ran-
domly red or blue (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), and we repeatedly
accepted proposed changes of color, of randomly chosen single
nodes, that did not increase the system’s energy. Although this
procedure does not correspond to a physical dynamics, it reveals
the energy minimum “closest” (in the sense of distance in phase
space) to a starting “solution” of randomly mixed red and blue
components. This closeness suggests that such states may be
kinetically accessible during growth from solution; we shall see
later that simplified growth simulations indeed reproduce these
inherent structures in certain regimes of parameter space.

The 2:1 kinetic traps obtained by the inherent structure pro-
cedure are found in a region of parameter space in which red and
blue nodes attract, and blue nodes repel (Fig. 3A). The noncovalent
side-chain–side-chain interactions implied by these parameters ap-
pear to be physically reasonable: molecular considerations suggest
that Lr and Lb struts may engage in aromatic donor–acceptor at-
tractions (23)—and the fact that they become incorporated within
the same framework indicates that they attract each other—and Lb
struts are bulky and may repel in an entropic sense. It is important
to note, however, that there is no direct mapping between our
simulation interactions and those of the real framework. Our sim-
ulated 2:1 structures are robust to changes of “solution composi-
tion” (Fig. 3A, Right), which we mimicked computationally by
including a chemical potential term [μC(i)] in our energy minimi-
zation procedure (Methods Summary).

In addition to the 2:1 local energy minima, there also exist
local energy minima with 1:0 and 1.2:1 component ratios, as well
as the corresponding reverse ratios (Fig. 3A). These ratios are
“magic” numbers in the sense that we observe abrupt “transi-
tions” between them as we vary the magnitudes of component
interaction energies (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). A requirement for
nontrivial ratios (here, 2:1 and 1.2:1) is that blue and red nodes
prefer to be neighbors within a framework, rather than to be
apart. A necessary condition for such correlation is that model
energetics are, in Ising model language, “antiferromagnetic”
(meaning that “red–blue” interactions have lower energy than
“blue–blue” and “red–red” ones; see dotted white line in Fig.
3A). This observation suggests that one requirement for robust
component ratios away from equilibrium is a particular hierarchy
of noncovalent interactions between component types.

The 2:1 Local Energy Minima Are “Compositional
Polycrystals” That Possess Spatial Properties Consistent
with Those Seen in Experiment
The 2:1 local energy minima are aperiodic and isotropic, con-
sistent with structures seen in experiment (Fig. 1B), and can
be thought of as compositional polycrystals (Fig. 4A). These we
define as materials whose physical structures are periodic, but
whose compositional degrees of freedom, i.e., component types,

are distributed within those structures as a patchwork of domains
of particular composition that meet at grain boundaries of dif-
ferent composition. The 2:1 structures are found in a region of
phase space in which the thermodynamic ground state (“global
energy minimum”) is an ordered 1:1 antiferromagnetic lattice
(meaning that each node has four nearest neighbors of the other
color). If we color the 2:1 structures according to their antifer-
romagnetic order, by identifying domains in which all nodes have
only unlike nodes as neighbors, then the resulting pictures are a
patchwork of domains or “grains” that are separated by all-red
regions that we call “grain boundaries” (Fig. 4A, Bottom). Al-
though an anisotropic and ordered 2:1 decoration of the nbo
lattice exists (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S15), it is not
accessible via this simulation procedure.

The 2:1 ratio of the model local energy minima emerges from
a combination of 1:1 ordered domains and all-red (1:0) grain
boundaries. The exact numerical ratio of red:blue nodes found in
simulation agrees with the value measured experimentally (Fig.
1C) and is a property of the overall topology of the nbo graph, not
just its local connectivity. When we repeated the inherent structure
procedure for a 2D square lattice (Fig. 4B)—which shares nbo’s
fourfold local connectivity but not its nonlocal connectivity (SI
Appendix, Fig. S19)—we found that structures in the correspond-
ing region of phase space look qualitatively similar, but possess a
red:blue ratio of 1.70:1 (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S18). The
corresponding ratio for the 3D cubic lattice (a possible interaction
network of, e.g., MOF-5) is different again, 2.2:1 (SI Appendix, Fig.
S21). The precise magic number ratio appears therefore to be a
function of both the noncovalent interactions between side chains,
and the framework topology.

Growth Simulations Reveal That Magic Number Component
Ratios Emerge for Particular Hierarchies and Scales of
Component Interaction Energies
With the objective of connecting our simulation approach more
closely to a possible assembly pathway of MOF-2000, we carried
out a simple Monte Carlo growth protocol (Methods Summary).
In this protocol, all nodes in the system were unoccupied
(colored white) initially and were allowed to become occupied (blue
or red) under a standard grand-canonical Monte Carlo protocol.
Rates of binding of red and blue nodes then depend on node–
node interaction energies. The overall growth rate of a red–blue
structure is controlled by a term μ, related to the chemical

potential of side chains in the parent solution, which sets the
relative energetics of unoccupied and occupied nodes. Our
growth protocol assumes implicitly that rates of establishment of
covalent linkages are modulated by side-chain–side-chain non-
covalent interaction energies. Experiment indicates that this
assumption must be true, because otherwise the two component
types—which form identical covalent linkages—would simply be
incorporated into the framework at the ratio at which they are
present in the parent solution.

In Fig. 5A, we show the results of growth simulations done
using node interaction energies taken from the regime in which
2:1 inherent structures (Fig. 3A) were found. For simplicity, we
arranged for a clear separation in scales of node interaction
energies (and hence binding rates). We set «b-r large and nega-
tive, and «b-b large and positive (with «b-r/«b-b → 0), so forbidding
blue–blue contacts and making red–blue contacts effectively
unbreakable. We set «r-r = 0 and kBT = 1. The thermodynami-
cally stable structure in this regime is the 1:1 antiferromagnetic
coloring, in which each node possesses four neighboring nodes of
the other color.

As seen in Fig. 5A, the nature of the structure generated dy-
namically depends on μ, the growth chemical potential. When μ
is large and negative, only blue–red contacts form. They do so
readily, and the structure that results is the thermodynamically
stable 1:1 coloring. When μ is large and positive, both blue–red
and red–red contacts form readily, and the result is a coloring
whose red:blue ratio depends on the red:blue ratio present in
implicit solution (we call this regime “irreversible”). Between
these extremes, we find a large range of growth rates that give
rise to spatially disordered 2:1 structures, independent of the
red:blue fraction in solution. This regime is one of “partially
reversible” growth: “native” (red–blue) contacts form readily and
do not break; “defect” (red–red) contacts can form and break
readily. The combination of these microscopic processes leads to
growth of structures similar to the 2:1 inherent structures seen in
energy minimization simulations, namely compositional poly-
crystals of thermodynamically favored 1:1 domains, separated by
red grain boundaries (SI Appendix, Fig. S22).

This growth procedure reveals that the inherent structures
described earlier can be obtained when a pattern of thermody-
namically desirable red–blue bonds is infiltrated by red–red bond
“mistakes” that occur because of the stochastic nature of as-
sembly (SI Appendix, Fig. S22). Simple although our growth

Local energy minima (inherent structures)
of the MOF-2000 simulation model have a 2:1 red:

energies. (A) MOF-2000 interaction networks were
simulated for a range of red–blue («r-b) and blue–
blue («b-b) node interaction energies.
Inherent
structures (local energy minima) possess well-de-
fined magic number component ratios; these de-
pend in an abrupt way on the hierarchy of
interaction energies (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Below
the dotted white line, node–node interaction en-
ergies are antiferromagnetic, in Ising model lan-
guage, meaning that red and blue nodes attract;
this is a necessary condition for nontrivial compo-
nent ratios (i.e., 1:0 and 0:1 are trivial ratios). The
2:1 structures (yellow sector) are found in a region
of phase space for which the thermodynamic
structure is a binary 1:1 coloring (SI Appendix, Fig.
S11), and are made of a patchwork of binary do-
mains (Fig. 4). (B) Magic number ratios are robust to

solution conditions: here, we vary the fraction fb

protocol is, it provides, in concert with the inherent structure
analysis, one possible explanation for the 2:1 ratio seen experi-
mentally: according to this analysis, the ratio results from kinetic
trapping of MOF-2000s components during their attempt to
assemble into a 1:1 thermodynamic structure. The resulting com-
ponent arrangements are consistent with those seen in experi-
ments: a 2:1 component ratio, without apparent anisotropy, ob-
tained over a wide range of solution component concentrations.

Finally, in Fig. 5 B and C, we show that growth simulations
done using the same hierarchy but reduced scale of noncovalent
interaction energies causes this solution-robust growth regime to
shrink (Fig. 5B) and eventually disappear (Fig. 5C). Similarly,
adopting a “ferromagnetic” hierarchy of energy scales (meaning
that red and blue nodes prefer to form like-color contacts; this
appears to be the case for the components of the MTV-MOF in
ref. 1) results in no regime of solution-robust component ratios
(Fig. 5D); none was seen in those experiments. Note that model

side-chain interactions cannot be mapped directly to experi-
mental parameters, because the former represent effective free
energies of interaction that in experiment are mediated by sol-
vent, etc. The difference between the energetic parameters dis-
played in Fig. 5 and the parameter μ would correspond roughly
to side-chain–side-chain equilibrium binding affinities, given a
set of component concentrations.

We have reported the assembly of a MOF whose two com-
ponents are incorporated in a 2:1 ratio, robust to changes in
relative concentration of struts in the initial solution. Compo-
nents are distributed throughout the framework in a manner that
is apparently isotropic and nonperiodic, making MOF-2000
unique among extended frameworks. Our simulations of a simple
and physically motivated model of MOF-2000 identify a set of
nonequilibrium structures that correspond to our experimental
observations. The simulated structures, which are local energy
minima and are also accessible to a microscopically reversible

corresponding ratio is 2.2:1 on a 3D cubic lattice, showing that dimensionality alone does not control the magic number ratio. Magic numbers obtained for a
range of local connectivity and dimensionality (SI Appendix, Fig. S20) further support the idea that magic number ratios may be tuned by the choice of framework
topology.

This regime is also robust to a range of relative concentrations of blue nodes in implicit solution (colored lines). (B and C) Growth simulations done using the

growth process, display a 2:1 ratio of components distributed
isotropically and nonperiodically, and emerge in a region of
phase space that corresponds to a physically reasonable side-
chain chemistry.

Although we cannot rule out a thermodynamic origin for
the 2:1 disordered regime, our findings suggest a possible non-
equilibrium origin for MOF-2000s robust composition ratio.
Previous work has demonstrated that kinetic trapping of
multiple component types during self-assembly can occur in a
variety of contexts (20, 24–29). Our simulations also suggest a
set of requirements for generating nontrivial magic number
ratios of components within covalent frameworks generally.
First, the hierarchy of noncovalent interactions between
components must be such that “local” energy minima are
nontrivial, i.e., not 1:0 (meaning that nodes must prefer en-
ergetically to be adjacent to nodes of another color) (Fig. 3A).
Second, the scale of interaction energies must be such that
“nonnative” (here red–red) contacts can form but do so re-
versibly; otherwise, the outcome of growth is the thermody-
namic structure (if nonnative contacts cannot form) or a
structure whose composition is sensitive to solution concen-
tration (if nonnative contacts form irreversibly). If these con-
ditions hold, then solution-robust ratios can be generated; the

precise numerical values of these ratios are a consequence of the
particular topology of the MOF (Fig. 4). Together, this set of
observations suggests a strategy for making multicomponent
covalent frameworks with solution-robust ratios of component
types. The utility of such frameworks awaits exploration.

potential μC(i ) is μ, −ln(f s
b) for w, b, and r, respectively. Here,
b is the relative fraction of reds versus blues in implicit solution, while μ is
f s
the chemical potential associated with removing/adding a colored site to the
system, and therefore controls the combined concentration of reds and
blues in solution. The latter is distinct from the relative fraction f s
b of reds
versus blues in solution.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed as follows. We selected a node at
random and proposed a change of color of that node. If the chosen node was
white, we attempted to make it colored; if the chosen node was colored, we
attempted to make it white. If the chosen node was white, then we proposed
s; otherwise, we proposed to make it red.
to make it blue with probability fb
No red–blue interchange was allowed, mimicking the idea that unbinding

events are required to relax configurational degrees of freedom. Starting
configurations were all white.

To maintain detailed balance with respect to the stated energy function,
the acceptance rates for these moves were as follows (ΔE is the energy
change resulting from the proposed move):
