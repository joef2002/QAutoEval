            "answer": "In the coordinative alignment method, the molecules make covalent bonds to well-defined metal sites of the MOF. These bonds anchor the molecules and lower their motional degrees of freedom, thereby promoting their alignment into an ordered pattern across the interior of the crystalline framework.",

            "answer": "Unlike the carboxylates which replaced all four formate ligands, the alkoxides and phenolates only replaced two formates on the same face of the SBU ring in addition to \u6e2d-OHs. This led to a doubling of the unit cell in the c-direction.",
