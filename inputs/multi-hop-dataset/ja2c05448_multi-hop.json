            "answer": "From ZUL-C1 to ZUL-C2, the expansion of the polycyclic moiety from a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane backbone to a cubane backbone extends the side of the pore channel, but the accompanying increase in ring number and moiety volume effectively reduces the dimension of the accessible pore space in specific directions and forms a contoured pore surface with more alkyl sites. This enables stronger trapping of guest molecules with relatively higher polarizability through enhanced van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding/dipolar interactions.",
