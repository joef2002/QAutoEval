            "answer": "Four of the HUMs - SIFSIX-21-Ni, NbOFFIVE-3-Ni, TIFSIX-4-Cu, and NbOFFIVE-3-Cu - were able to break the trade-off, exhibiting adsorption capacities \u922e?.5 mmol\u8defg\u922d? and separation selectivities \u922e? for C2H2/CO2 separation.",

            "answer": "In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements were performed on NbOFFIVE-3-Cu and SIFSIX-21-Ni to probe the binding sites of C2H2 and CO2. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was also used to investigate the behavior of 13CO2 and C2D2 adsorbed in NbOFFIVE-3-Cu.",

            "answer": "The difference in isosteric heats of adsorption between C2H2 and CO2, \u8796Qst(C2H2/CO2), reflects the relative thermodynamic preference of the sorbents for C2H2 over CO2. A higher \u8796Qst(C2H2/CO2) value indicates a stronger affinity for C2H2 compared to CO2.",

            "answer": "Studying sorbent performance under dynamic conditions like DCB experiments is important because calculating separation performance from single-component C2H2 and CO2 isotherms tends to overestimate the actual separation ability. DCB experiments provide a more realistic assessment of how the sorbents will perform in real-world separation processes.",

            "question": "How does the modularity of HUMs enable fine-tuning of their pore size and chemistry for enhanced gas separation performance?",
            "answer": "The modularity of HUMs allows for crystal engineering-driven control of pore size and chemistry by varying the organic linker ligands, inorganic pillar ligands, and metal cations used to construct the frameworks. This enables systematic optimization of the HUM structure and properties for specific gas separation applications.",

            "question": "Based on the IR and NMR spectroscopy results, what interactions are thought to be responsible for the stronger binding of C2H2 compared to CO2 in the HUMs?",
            "answer": "The IR and NMR results suggest that C2H2 forms stronger interactions with the HUMs, including hydrogen bonding interactions via the acidic C-H groups, compared to CO2. The spectroscopic data shows evidence of multiple strong C2H2 binding sites, while CO2 appears to interact more weakly with the frameworks.",

        {
            "question": "Why is it advantageous for the HUMs to exhibit weak CO2 binding in addition to strong C2H2 affinity for achieving high C2H2/CO2 selectivity?",
            "answer": "Weak CO2 binding in the HUMs is advantageous because it means CO2 will be more easily displaced by C2H2 and rapidly eluted from the sorbent bed during separation processes. The combination of strong C2H2 affinity and weak CO2 interactions leads to a large difference in binding strength, \u8796Qst(C2H2/CO2), which is key for achieving high C2H2/CO2 selectivity.",
