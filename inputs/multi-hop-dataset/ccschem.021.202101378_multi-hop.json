            "question": "Why does the organic part of organotin make the MOFs hydrophobic?",
            "answer": "The organic part like methyl, butyl groups in the organotin SBUs point into the pores and channels of the MOFs, creating a hydrophobic pore environment that repels water. This makes the internal surface of the MOFs hydrophobic.",

            "question": "How does the length of the organic group in organotin affect the hydrophobicity of the MOFs?",
            "answer": "As the length of the organic group like methyl to butyl increases from SnTCPP-SQL to SnTCPP-PTS and SnTCPP-SHE, the water contact angle increases from 82\u63b3 to 170\u63b3 and 165\u63b3 respectively. This indicates increasing hydrophobicity with longer organic chains in the organotin SBUs.",

            "question": "What makes SnTCPP-PTS a good candidate for oil-water separation applications?",
            "answer": "SnTCPP-PTS has a combination of high porosity to absorb oils, superhydrophobicity to repel water, excellent chemical stability in a wide pH range, and nanoscale morphology allowing it to be easily coated on fabrics. These attributes make it very useful for efficient oil-water separation.",
