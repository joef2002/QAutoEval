This spin-crossover involves a complex sequence of intermediate phases with different symmetries.",

            "answer": "The anomalous increase of the c lattice parameter between the two phase transitions at Tc1 and Tc2 is correlated with the softening of the Raman mode associated with the squeezing of the tvp ligand in the same temperature range. This suggests the tvp ligands interact with the guest molecules through hydrogen bonds, which affects both the structure and vibrational properties.",

            "answer": "The radial distribution functions between the centers of mass of the benzaldehyde molecules show the guests adopt a sandwich conformation favoring \u87fa-\u87fa interactions. The first peak is at a shorter distance in the MOF compared to the bulk phase, indicating the size and shape of the MOF channels forces the molecules into this conformation. The radial distribution functions between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of the guest molecules also reveal hydrogen bonding interactions between the guests along the channel direction.",

            "answer": "The plateau at xHS = 1/4 in the low symmetry phase III can be explained by the formation of a periodic spin-state concentration wave during the spin-crossover. The symmetry breaking generates inequivalent Fe sites that allows for long-range ordering of high-spin and low-spin states in a pattern compatible with the 1/4 high-spin fraction.",

            "answer": "DFT calculations were used to obtain the vibrational mode frequencies of a molecular model of the [Fe(tvp)2(NCS)2] MOF in order to interpret the experimental Raman data and identify the relevant modes. DFT allowed calculating the modes separately for the high-spin and low-spin states.",

            "answer": "The host-guest and guest-guest interactions, in particular hydrogen bonding, play an essential role in the symmetry breaking phase transitions and spin-crossover behavior. MD simulations show the benzaldehyde guests form hydrogen bonds with the MOF framework as well as between each other along the channels. These interactions, combined with confinement effects, determine the guest arrangement. The anomalous structural changes and Raman mode softening also indicate the importance of host-guest coupling. Therefore, the guest molecules mediate the phase transitions and spin-state ordering in the material.",
