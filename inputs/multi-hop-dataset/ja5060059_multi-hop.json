            "answer": "ZAG-4 has a bulk modulus of 15.7 GPa, which is higher than the typical 2-5 GPa range for soft porous crystals, due to its denser structure.",

            "answer": "The negative linear compressibility in ZAG-4 above 2 GPa is due to the occurrence of a structural transition at 3.8 GPa involving a reversible proton transfer between a water molecule and a phosphonate group.",

            "question": "What is the driving force for the pressure-induced proton transfer in ZAG-4?",
            "answer": "The driving force for the pressure-induced proton transfer is that compression brings the phosphonate group closer to the water molecule. The proton jump allows forming a very short O-H bond in H3O+, yielding an overall smaller O-O distance and unit cell volume, which is favorable at high pressure.",

            "question": "Why does ZAG-6 exhibit both a proton transfer and alkyl chain coiling under pressure, while ZAG-4 only shows the proton transfer?",
            "answer": "ZAG-6 exhibits both transitions because it has a longer, more flexible 6-carbon alkyl chain linker compared to the shorter 4-carbon chain in ZAG-4. The longer chain enables the additional coiling transition to occur under pressure in ZAG-6.",

        {
            "question": "Based on the enthalpy profiles, why are ZAG-4 and ZAG-6 proposed as potential pressure-switchable proton conduction materials?",
            "answer": "The enthalpy barrier for the proton transfer becomes quite low (down to 2.4 kT) at intermediate pressures around 2 GPa. This suggests the proton can diffuse rapidly along the hydrogen-bonded chain of water and phosphonate at these pressures, enabling proton conduction that can be switched by pressure.",

        },
        {
            "question": "Why do the quantum chemical calculations neglect entropic effects when determining the pressure-induced transitions?",
            "answer": "The quantum chemical calculations are restricted to calculating the enthalpy H, while the Gibbs free energy G that dictates the transition at finite temperature also includes an entropic term -TS. Therefore, entropic effects are neglected in this approach.",

            "question": "How do ZAG-4 and ZAG-6 compare to other flexible MOFs in terms of their elastic properties and behavior under pressure?",
            "answer": "ZAG-4 and ZAG-6 exhibit some characteristics of soft porous crystals like wine-rack MOFs, such as negative linear compressibility and highly anisotropic elastic properties. However, they are overall more robust with higher bulk moduli due to their denser structures. They also display rare pressure-induced bond rearrangements not typically seen in other flexible MOFs.",

            "question": "What makes the pressure-induced proton transfer in ZAG-4 and ZAG-6 a significant finding for metal-organic frameworks and materials in general?",
            "answer": "Pressure-induced proton transfer is a very rare phenomenon in materials in general, and this is the first case reported for a metal-organic framework. Reversible pressure-induced bond rearrangements like this are also very uncommon. Therefore, the behavior of the ZAG materials represents novel pressure responses for MOFs and materials science.",
