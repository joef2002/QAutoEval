            "answer": "In the MOF, the excited state has intra-ligand (IL) \u87fa-\u87fa* character, while in solution an MLCT excited state is typically observed. This suggests the \u87fa-\u87fa* state is lower in energy than the MLCT state in the MOF environment.",

At longer times, only \u87fa-\u87fa* bands remain, indicating conversion from MLCT to \u87fa-\u87fa*.",

            "answer": "The manganese complex has a higher quantum yield for CO loss and fac to mer isomerization compared to the rhenium complex. This enabled a high enough conversion to the mer isomer to be observed crystallographically.",

            "question": "How can the MOF environment help overcome limitations in applying time-resolved crystallography to photoactive molecules?",
            "answer": "Structural changes can occur within the MOF framework without fundamentally altering the crystal lattice integrity. This can reduce laser-induced crystal damage that often limits time-resolved crystallography studies of molecular excited states.",

            "question": "What is the proposed explanation for why the IL \u87fa-\u87fa* state is stabilized relative to the MLCT state in the MOF environment?",
            "answer": "The lack of stabilizing solvent molecules and the presence of the carboxylate groups on the bipyridine ligand in the MOF may combine to raise the energy of the MLCT state above the \u87fa-\u87fa* state.",

            "answer": "New IR bands appear that match the frequencies expected for the mer isomer as well as mono- and di-carbonyl intermediates. The CO loss product bands decrease upon warming with growth of both fac and mer isomer bands.",
