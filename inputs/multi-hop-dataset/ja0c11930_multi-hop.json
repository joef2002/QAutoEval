            "answer": "Three distinct ND3 binding sites were found in MFM-300(Fe), compared to two sites in MFM-300(M) (M = In, VIII), due to the higher ND3 loading in the MFM-300(Fe) experiment.",

            "answer": "Compared to solid NH3, the INS spectra of adsorbed NH3 in MFM-300(Al) show a red-shift and broadening of peaks in the translational, librational and rocking regions.

            "answer": "The single crystal XRD studies show that the charge transfer between adsorbed NH3 and the VIV center to form N2H4 only occurs above a certain NH3 loading threshold. This suggests sufficient occupancy of NH3 close to the metal sites is needed to initiate the redox reaction.",

            "answer": "The redox-active VIV center in MFM-300(VIV) oxidizes some of the adsorbed NH3 to N2H4 which remains strongly bound and accumulates in the MOF over cycles. This increases the residual NH3 and also enhances the adsorption capacity in subsequent cycles, unlike the redox-inactive MFM-300 analogs.",

            "answer": "The discrepancy is attributed to the fundamentally different nature of the isothermal and breakthrough experiments. Isotherms are measured under equilibrium conditions with pure NH3, while breakthrough occurs under flow with ppm levels of NH3. Therefore, both kinetic and thermodynamic factors influence the dynamic uptake.",
