            "answer": "The methane adsorption isotherms of Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) feature a sharp step, transitioning from minimal adsorption at low pressures to high adsorption at higher pressures. This enables high usable capacities between the storage and minimum desorption pressures.",

            "answer": "Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) undergo a reversible structural phase transition between a collapsed, non-porous phase at low methane pressures and an expanded, porous phase at high methane pressures. This phase transition is responsible for the stepped adsorption isotherms.",

            "answer": "In the collapsed phase of Co(bdp), the central benzene ring of the bdp2- ligand twists 25\u63b3 out of the pyrazolate plane, resulting in edge-to-face \u87fa-\u87fa interactions with four neighboring benzene rings. These interactions likely provide the thermodynamic driving force for the collapse at low pressures.",

            "answer": "The expansion of the Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) frameworks during methane adsorption is endothermic, so some of the heat of adsorption goes towards providing the energy for the phase transition. This reduces the overall heat released compared to adsorption in a rigid framework without a phase transition.",

            "answer": "The differential enthalpy of methane adsorption in the steepest region of the Co(bdp) isotherm is -8.4 kJ/mol, which is considerably lower than the -12 to -25 kJ/mol seen in classical adsorbents with high methane capacities. This is because the endothermic framework expansion partially offsets the heat of adsorption.",

            "answer": "73.4 kJ of heat is released per liter of Co(bdp) when increasing the methane pressure from 5.8 to 35 bar. This represents a 33% reduction compared to the 109 kJ/L released by HKUST-1, even though Co(bdp) adsorbs 8% more methane.",
