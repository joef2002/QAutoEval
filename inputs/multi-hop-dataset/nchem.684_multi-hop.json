            "answer": "The selectivity for O2 and NO over CO2 arises from the charge-transfer interaction between O2/NO and the electron-donating TCNQ ligands, not simply from size-based discrimination, since CO2 actually has a smaller kinetic diameter than O2 and NO.",

            "answer": "The lack of change in the \u672a(C-H) band at 805 cm-1 indicates that the TCNQ moieties remain in their dimeric form during the O2 sorption process, while the shift in the \u8c13(C\u922e\ue4d4) bands shows a change in the electron density and conjugation of the TCNQ \u87fa-system due to charge transfer with O2.",

            "answer": "18O2 was used in addition to 16O2 in order to definitively assign the sharp band at 1454 cm-1 to the O=O stretching mode of adsorbed oxygen. This band disappeared when switching from a 16O2 to an 18O2 atmosphere, confirming it arises from adsorbed O2 rather than the framework.",

            "answer": "The large redshift of the O=O stretching band suggests the adsorbed O2 molecules have a partial negative charge due to a combination of 1) charge transfer from the electron-donating framework and 2) confinement effects from adsorption in the pores.",

            "question": "How do the reduction energies of O2 and NO compare to those of the other gases studied, and how does this relate to the selective adsorption by 1?",
            "answer": "O2 and NO have lower reduction energies and better electron acceptability compared to the other gases. This electron acceptability allows them to engage in charge-transfer interactions with the electron-donating framework of 1, leading to selective adsorption over the other gases.",

            "answer": "The structural dynamics (closed-open structural transformation) provides a size/shape-based selectivity while the electronic functionality (electron-donating TCNQ ligands) provides a specific charge-transfer interaction with O2 and NO. Together, these properties enable the highly selective adsorption of O2 and NO over other gases by 1.",
