            "answer": "To preserve charge balance with the Au:S:Na:Cs ratio of 2:2:2:1, half of the thiomalate ligands must be monoprotonated. This is consistent with commercial Myochrysine being a mixture of monosodium and disodium salts.",

            "answer": "The structure of gold thiomalate is reminiscent of a previously reported polymeric silver thiolate (AgSR)n structure, which also involves intertwined, double-stranded metal/sulfur chains. The main difference is the repeating unit is octameric (AgSR)8 in the silver case, while it is tetrameric in gold thiomalate.",
